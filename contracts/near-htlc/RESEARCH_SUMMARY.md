# NEAR Protocol Research Summary for 1inch Fusion+ Cross-Chain Swap

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes comprehensive research on implementing Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC) on NEAR Protocol for 1inch Fusion+ cross-chain swaps. 

**Key Conclusion**: NEAR requires a completely different implementation approach than Ethereum due to its non-EVM architecture, but it's fully capable of supporting the required HTLC functionality.

## 1. Smart Contract Development (Rust vs AssemblyScript)

### Recommendation: Use Rust

**Reasoning:**
- Financial applications require maximum safety guarantees
- Rust's memory safety and type system prevent critical bugs
- More mature toolchain with better NEAR SDK support
- NEAR itself is written in Rust

**AssemblyScript Alternative:**
- Only suitable for prototypes or non-financial use cases
- Learning time: hours vs weeks for Rust
- Limited safety guarantees

## 2. HTLC Implementation on NEAR

### Existing Implementation Analysis

The codebase already contains a basic HTLC implementation with:
- Basic escrow creation and management
- Secret hash validation using SHA256
- Timeout handling
- NEAR token support

### Required Enhancements for 1inch Fusion+

1. **Multiple Time Lock Periods**:
   - Finality lock (beneficiary-only claim period)
   - Cancel time (resolver can cancel)
   - Public cancel time (anyone can cancel)

2. **Safety Deposit Mechanism**:
   - Additional deposit to incentivize proper resolution
   - Configurable beneficiary for safety deposit

3. **NEP-141 Token Support**:
   - Handle fungible tokens (NEAR's ERC-20 equivalent)
   - Batch operations for efficiency

## 3. NEAR Account Model Differences

| Feature | NEAR | Ethereum |
|---------|------|----------|
| Account IDs | Human-readable (alice.near) | Hex addresses |
| Access Keys | Multiple with permissions | Single private key |
| Key Types | Full Access & Function Call | Only one type |
| Storage | Requires staking | Included in gas |
| Creation | Requires funding | Free |

### Access Key Benefits
- Function Call keys can be limited to specific contracts/methods
- Gas allowances prevent excessive spending
- Better security through key separation

## 4. Cross-Contract Calls and Promises

### Asynchronous Nature
```rust
// All cross-contract calls return Promises
Promise::new(recipient).transfer(amount)
    .then(Self::ext(env::current_account_id())
        .on_transfer_complete(escrow_id));
```

### Key Differences from Ethereum:
- Calls execute 1-2 blocks later
- Manual state rollback required on failures
- Callbacks must be explicitly handled
- No automatic revert on error

## 5. Storage Staking and Gas Economics

### Storage Costs
- 1 NEAR per 100KB of storage
- Storage stake is locked, not consumed
- Released when data is deleted
- Must be considered in contract design

### Gas Economics
- Maximum 300 TGas per transaction (~300ms)
- Fixed pricing (no priority fees)
- 30% of gas fees go to contract developer
- 70% is burned

## 6. Existing HTLC/Atomic Swap Implementations

### Research Findings
- **Liquality**: Announced NEAR support but no public code found
- **Rainbow Bridge**: Not suitable for atomic swaps (too slow)
- **No Public Examples**: No open-source NEAR HTLC implementations found

### Implications
- We're implementing one of the first public NEAR HTLCs
- Can become a reference implementation for others
- Opportunity to establish best practices

## 7. Timeout and Refund Handling

### NEAR-Specific Considerations
1. **No Automatic Rollback**: Must manually revert state
2. **Promise Results**: Check in callbacks
3. **Refund Pattern**:
   ```rust
   match env::promise_result(0) {
       PromiseResult::Failed => {
           // Manual refund logic
           Promise::new(sender).transfer(amount);
       }
   }
   ```

## 8. NEAR Testnet Setup

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Install tools
npm install -g near-cli
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Create account
near create-account htlc.testnet --useFaucet

# Deploy
near deploy htlc.testnet ./target/near/htlc.wasm
```

### Testing Tools
- Explorer: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/
- Wallet: https://wallet.testnet.near.org/
- RPC: https://rpc.testnet.near.org

## 9. Cross-Chain Integration Patterns

### Option 1: Direct HTLC (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Lower latency (minutes vs hours)
- Lower cost ($1-2 vs $10-60)
- Full control over timing

**Cons:**
- Requires custom implementation
- Need coordination service

### Option 2: Rainbow Bridge
**Pros:**
- Existing infrastructure
- Battle-tested

**Cons:**
- High latency (6min/16hrs)
- High cost
- Not suitable for time-sensitive swaps

### Option 3: Chain Signatures (Future)
- New NEAR feature for cross-chain operations
- Still in development
- Could simplify future implementations

## 10. Existing Bridges and Solutions

### Rainbow Bridge Architecture
- Uses light clients on both chains
- Relayers update block headers
- Connectors handle asset logic
- Watchers provide security

### Key Insight
Rainbow Bridge's architecture (lock-and-mint) differs fundamentally from HTLC atomic swaps. HTLCs are better suited for 1inch Fusion+ requirements.

## Implementation Status

### Completed
✅ Basic HTLC contract structure  
✅ Enhanced Fusion+ compatible contract  
✅ Deployment scripts  
✅ JavaScript coordination example  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  

### Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
2. **Security Audit**: Review by NEAR experts
3. **Relayer Service**: Build coordination layer
4. **Mainnet Deployment**: After thorough testing

## Key Takeaways

1. **NEAR is Non-EVM**: Requires complete reimplementation, not porting
2. **Asynchronous by Design**: Must handle callbacks and manual rollbacks
3. **Storage Economics**: Factor in staking requirements
4. **Limited Examples**: We're pioneering NEAR HTLC implementations
5. **Promising Platform**: NEAR's features (access keys, low fees) make it ideal for cross-chain swaps

## Recommendations

1. **Use Rust**: Only viable option for production financial contracts
2. **Implement Direct HTLC**: Don't rely on Rainbow Bridge for atomic swaps
3. **Plan for Async**: Design with callbacks and error handling from start
4. **Consider Storage**: Optimize data structures for cost efficiency
5. **Test Thoroughly**: NEAR's async nature requires comprehensive testing
