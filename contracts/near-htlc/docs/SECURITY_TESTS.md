# NEAR HTLC Security Test Suite

This document describes the comprehensive security tests created to verify the NEAR HTLC implementation addresses all vulnerabilities identified in the code review.

## Overview

The security test suite consists of three main components:
1. **Rust Unit Tests** - Core contract logic testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Full end-to-end testing using near-workspaces
3. **TypeScript Tests** - Orchestrator and cross-chain interaction testing

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run individual test suites
cargo test                          # Rust unit tests
cargo test --test integration_tests # Integration tests
npm test                           # TypeScript tests
```

### Detailed Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific security vulnerability tests
cargo test test_hash_verification_with_binary_data -- --nocapture
cargo test test_timestamp_overflow_protection -- --nocapture
cargo test test_batch_cancel_reentrancy_protection -- --nocapture

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Coverage by Vulnerability

### 1. Hash Verification with Binary Data

**Issue**: Secret was treated as string instead of binary data, and base58 encoding/decoding consistency wasn't ensured.

**Tests**:
- `test_hash_verification_with_binary_data` - Verifies proper handling of binary secrets
- `test_invalid_hex_secret` - Ensures invalid hex strings are rejected
- `test_base58_encoding_consistency` - Tests various binary patterns for consistent encoding
- TypeScript: `should handle binary data correctly in hash conversion`

**What's Tested**:
- Binary data is properly encoded/decoded
- Hash generation is consistent and deterministic
- Base58 encoding/decoding roundtrips correctly
- Invalid hex inputs are rejected

### 2. Timestamp Precision and Overflow

**Issue**: NEAR uses nanosecond timestamps while parameters are in seconds, risking overflow with u64 limits.

**Tests**:
- `test_timestamp_precision_nanoseconds` - Verifies correct nanosecond conversion
- `test_timestamp_overflow_protection` - Tests overflow detection
- `test_security_timestamp_overflow` (integration) - Full contract test
- TypeScript: `should detect timestamp overflow`

**What's Tested**:
- Seconds to nanoseconds conversion is correct
- Overflow conditions are detected and prevented
- Large time periods don't cause unexpected behavior
- Timestamp ordering is maintained

### 3. Fixed Gas Limits

**Issue**: Fixed gas values may break with future NEAR upgrades.

**Tests**:
- `test_gas_limit_edge_cases` (integration) - Tests with minimal gas
- TypeScript: `calculateDynamicGas` - Dynamic gas calculation implementation

**What's Tested**:
- Contract functions work with varying gas amounts
- Dynamic gas calculation based on operation complexity
- Gas estimation includes data size considerations

### 4. Reentrancy Attack Prevention

**Issue**: Loop processing in batch_cancel has potential reentrancy risks.

**Tests**:
- `test_batch_cancel_reentrancy_protection` - Unit test for state consistency
- `test_reentrancy_protection_batch_cancel` (integration) - Full reentrancy test
- TypeScript: `safeBatchCancel` - Safe batch processing implementation

**What's Tested**:
- State changes are atomic
- Batch operations maintain consistency
- No double-processing of escrows
- Rate limiting between batches

### 5. TypeScript Orchestrator Errors

**Issue**: `base_encode` is not a valid NEAR API function.

**Tests**:
- TypeScript: Full test suite for proper encoding
- `convertHashForNear` - Correct bs58 implementation

**What's Fixed**:
- Uses `bs58.encode()` instead of non-existent `base_encode`
- Proper binary data handling
- Consistent hash format conversion between chains

### 6. Cross-Contract Call Failures

**Issue**: Need proper handling of failed token transfers.

**Tests**:
- `test_callback_failure_reverts_state` - Callback failure handling
- `test_cross_contract_failure_handling` (integration) - Non-existent token test
- `test_nep141_token_escrow` - Successful token transfer flow

**What's Tested**:
- Failed transfers revert escrow state
- Callbacks properly handle promise failures
- Token and NEAR transfers are handled differently
- Non-existent contracts don't lock funds

### 7. Timeout Boundary Tests

**Tests**:
- `test_claim_at_finality_boundary` - Claiming at exact boundary
- `test_claim_after_finality` - Rejection after finality
- `test_unauthorized_cancel_before_public` - Permission checks at boundaries

**What's Tested**:
- Exact boundary conditions (off-by-one errors)
- Time-based permission changes
- State transitions at timeout boundaries

### 8. Authorization and Access Control

**Tests**:
- `test_unauthorized_claim` - Only beneficiary can claim
- `test_unauthorized_cancel_before_public` - Resolver-only period
- Various permission scenarios in integration tests

**What's Tested**:
- Only authorized parties can perform actions
- Time-based permission changes work correctly
- Public cancellation period allows anyone to cancel

### 9. Input Validation

**Tests**:
- `test_invalid_time_ordering` - Time period validation
- `test_insufficient_deposit` - Deposit amount validation
- TypeScript: `validateEscrowParams` - Comprehensive validation

**What's Tested**:
- All input parameters are validated
- Edge cases are handled properly
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs

## Security Test Patterns

### Rust Unit Tests
Located in `src/fusion_htlc.rs` under `#[cfg(test)]`:
- Fast, isolated tests of contract logic
- Mock NEAR runtime environment
- Test specific vulnerability scenarios

### Integration Tests
Located in `tests/integration_tests.rs`:
- Deploy actual contracts to sandbox
- Test cross-contract interactions
- Verify end-to-end flows
- Test with real NEAR runtime

### TypeScript Tests
Located in `tests/orchestrator.test.ts`:
- Test client-side logic
- Verify proper API usage
- Test error handling and retries
- Ensure cross-chain consistency

## Adding New Security Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Identify the specific vulnerability
2. Create minimal reproduction case
3. Add unit test for the specific issue
4. Add integration test for full scenario
5. Update this documentation

## Continuous Security Testing

Recommendations:
1. Run security tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. Add fuzzing tests for input validation
3. Regular security audits of test coverage
4. Monitor for new NEAR SDK security advisories
5. Test with each NEAR protocol upgrade
