# NEAR HTLC Security Improvements

This document summarizes the security improvements implemented following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Binary Data Hash Verification ✅
**Issue**: Hash verification was treating secrets as strings instead of binary data.
**Fix**: 
- Proper hex decoding of secrets before hashing
- Comprehensive test coverage for various binary patterns including null bytes and UTF-8 incompatible bytes
- Validation of hex input format

### 2. Timestamp Overflow Protection ✅
**Issue**: Timestamp calculations could overflow when converting seconds to nanoseconds.
**Fix**:
- Added `MAX_TIME_PERIOD_SECONDS` constant (10 years maximum)
- Implemented `safe_add_time()` method using saturating arithmetic
- Input validation in `create_escrow()` to reject periods that could cause overflow
- Test coverage for edge cases near u64::MAX

### 3. Dynamic Gas Limits ✅
**Issue**: Fixed gas limits could break with future NEAR protocol upgrades.
**Fix**:
- Renamed constants to `BASE_GAS_FOR_*` to indicate they're base values
- Added `GAS_PER_BATCH_ITEM` for dynamic calculation
- Implemented `calculate_gas()` method for future gas adjustments
- Ready for dynamic gas calculation based on operation complexity

### 4. Reentrancy Protection in batch_cancel ✅
**Issue**: Potential reentrancy vulnerability when processing duplicate escrow IDs.
**Fix**:
- Added HashSet to track processed IDs and prevent duplicates
- Returns list of actually cancelled escrow IDs
- State changes occur before external calls
- Test coverage for duplicate ID scenarios

### 5. Cross-Contract Failure Handling ✅
**Issue**: Need robust handling of failed token transfers.
**Fix**:
- Existing `on_transfer_complete` callback properly reverts state on failure
- Tests verify behavior with non-existent token contracts
- Promise-based architecture ensures atomic operations

## Test Coverage

### Security Test Suite (`tests/security_tests.rs`)
1. **Binary Data Tests**
   - Edge cases: all zeros, all ones, alternating patterns
   - UTF-8 incompatible bytes
   - Invalid hex string handling

2. **Timestamp Tests**
   - Overflow protection at boundaries
   - Large but safe values (years)
   - Exact overflow detection

3. **Gas Limit Tests**
   - Dynamic gas calculation for different batch sizes
   - Stress testing with 50+ escrows

4. **Reentrancy Tests**
   - Duplicate ID handling in batch operations
   - State consistency verification

5. **Integration Tests**
   - Cross-contract failure scenarios
   - Timing attack prevention
   - Safety deposit edge cases

### TypeScript Tests (`tests/orchestrator.test.ts`)
- Fixed base_encode to use bs58.encode
- Binary data handling across chains
- Timestamp overflow detection
- Parameter validation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**
   - All time periods validated against maximum safe values
   - Hex secret format validation
   - Amount positivity checks

2. **Arithmetic Safety**
   - Using saturating_add/saturating_mul throughout
   - Overflow checks enabled in Cargo.toml
   - No unsafe arithmetic operations

3. **State Management**
   - State changes before external calls
   - Atomic operations with callbacks
   - Proper error handling with state reversion

4. **Gas Management**
   - Conservative gas estimates
   - Dynamic calculation capability
   - Future-proof design

## Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
./scripts/run_security_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test security_tests

# Run with verbose output
cargo test --test security_tests -- --nocapture
```

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic reviews as NEAR protocol evolves
2. **Gas Monitoring**: Monitor actual gas usage in production and adjust base values if needed
3. **Upgrade Path**: Consider implementing upgradeable contracts for future improvements
4. **Formal Verification**: Consider formal verification for critical paths

## Conclusion

All identified security issues have been addressed following TDD principles:
- ✅ Binary data handling
- ✅ Timestamp overflow protection
- ✅ Dynamic gas limits ready
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Cross-contract failure handling

The contract now has comprehensive test coverage and follows security best practices for NEAR smart contracts.
