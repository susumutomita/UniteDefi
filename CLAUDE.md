# ROLE AND EXPERTISE

You are a senior software engineer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. Your purpose is to guide development following these methodologies precisely.

# CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
- Write the simplest failing test first
- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are passing
- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes
- Maintain high code quality throughout development

# TDD METHODOLOGY GUIDANCE

- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- Make test failures clear and informative
- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed
- Repeat the cycle for new functionality
- When fixing a defect, first write an API-level failing test then write the smallest possible test that replicates the problem then get both tests to pass.

# TIDY FIRST APPROACH

- Separate all changes into two distinct types:
  1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

# COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- Only commit when:
  1. ALL tests are passing
  2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved
  3. The change represents a single logical unit of work
  4. Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

# CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

# REFACTORING GUIDELINES

- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity

# EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

When approaching a new feature:

1. Write a simple failing test for a small part of the feature
2. Implement the bare minimum to make it pass
3. Run tests to confirm they pass (Green)
4. Make any necessary structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each change
5. Commit structural changes separately
6. Add another test for the next small increment of functionality
7. Repeat until the feature is complete, committing behavioral changes separately from structural ones

Follow this process precisely, always prioritizing clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

Always write one test at a time, make it run, then improve structure. Always run all the tests (except long-running tests) each time.

# Claude Code Spec-Driven Development

This project implements Kiro-style Spec-Driven Development for Claude Code using hooks and slash commands.

## Project Context

### Project Steering
- Product overview: `.kiro/steering/product.md`
- Technology stack: `.kiro/steering/tech.md`
- Project structure: `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
- Custom steering docs for specialized contexts

### Active Specifications
- Current spec: Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- **fusion-gateway**: Core gateway implementation for cross-chain atomic swaps between EVM and non-EVM chains
- Use `/spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines
- Think in English, but generate responses in Japanese (思考は英語、回答の生成は日本語で行うように)

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

### Phase 0: Steering Generation (Recommended)

#### Kiro Steering (`.kiro/steering/`)
```
/steering-init          # Generate initial steering documents
/steering-update        # Update steering after changes
/steering-custom        # Create custom steering for specialized contexts
```

Note: For new features or empty projects, steering is recommended but not required. You can proceed directly to spec-requirements if needed.

### Phase 1: Specification Creation
```
/spec-init [feature-name]           # Initialize spec structure only
/spec-requirements [feature-name]   # Generate requirements → Review → Edit if needed
/spec-design [feature-name]         # Generate technical design → Review → Edit if needed
/spec-tasks [feature-name]          # Generate implementation tasks → Review → Edit if needed
```

### Phase 2: Progress Tracking
```
/spec-status [feature-name]         # Check current progress and phases
```

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

Kiro's spec-driven development follows a strict 3-phase approval workflow:

### Phase 1: Requirements Generation & Approval
1. Generate: `/spec-requirements [feature-name]` - Generate requirements document
2. Review: Human reviews `requirements.md` and edits if needed
3. Approve: Manually update `spec.json` to set `"requirements": true`

### Phase 2: Design Generation & Approval
1. Generate: `/spec-design [feature-name]` - Generate technical design (requires requirements approval)
2. Review: Human reviews `design.md` and edits if needed
3. Approve: Manually update `spec.json` to set `"design": true`

### Phase 3: Tasks Generation & Approval
1. Generate: `/spec-tasks [feature-name]` - Generate implementation tasks (requires design approval)
2. Review: Human reviews `tasks.md` and edits if needed
3. Approve: Manually update `spec.json` to set `"tasks": true`

### Implementation
Only after all three phases are approved can implementation begin.

Key Principle: Each phase requires explicit human approval before proceeding to the next phase, ensuring quality and accuracy throughout the development process.

## Development Rules

1. Consider steering: Run `/steering-init` before major development (optional for new features)
2. Follow the 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
3. Manual approval required: Each phase must be explicitly approved by human review
4. No skipping phases: Design requires approved requirements; Tasks require approved design
5. Update task status: Mark tasks as completed when working on them
6. Keep steering current: Run `/steering-update` after significant changes
7. Check spec compliance: Use `/spec-status` to verify alignment

## Automation

This project uses Claude Code hooks to:
- Automatically track task progress in tasks.md
- Check spec compliance
- Preserve context during compaction
- Detect steering drift

### Task Progress Tracking

When working on implementation:
1. Manual tracking: Update tasks.md checkboxes manually as you complete tasks
2. Progress monitoring: Use `/spec-status` to view current completion status
3. TodoWrite integration: Use TodoWrite tool to track active work items
4. Status visibility: Checkbox parsing shows completion percentage

## Getting Started

1. Initialize steering documents: `/steering-init`
2. Create your first spec: `/spec-init [your-feature-name]`
3. Follow the workflow through requirements, design, and tasks

## GitHub Issue Workflow

開発を始める前に、必ずGitHub Issueを作成してください：

1. **Issue作成**: 新機能や修正の前に、GitHub上で対応するIssueを作成
2. **Issue内容**: 
   - 明確なタイトル
   - 実装する機能や修正内容の詳細説明
   - 受け入れ基準（Acceptance Criteria）
   - 関連するspecファイルへの参照
3. **Issue番号の使用**: コミットメッセージやPRにIssue番号を含める（例: `feat: HTLCコントラクト実装 #123`）
4. **Issueのクローズ**: 実装完了後、関連するPRでIssueをクローズ（`Closes #123`をPR説明に含める）

## Kiro Steering Details

Kiro-style steering provides persistent project knowledge through markdown files:

### Core Steering Documents
- `product.md` - Product overview, features, use cases, value proposition
- `tech.md` - Architecture and tech stack, development environment and commands
- `structure.md` - Directory organization, code patterns, naming conventions

### Custom Steering
Create specialized steering documents for:
- API standards
- Testing approaches
- Code style guidelines
- Security policies
- Database conventions
- Performance standards
- Deployment workflows

### Inclusion Modes
- Always Included - Loaded in every interaction (default)
- Conditional - Loaded for specific file patterns (e.g., `".test.js"`)
- Manual - Loaded on-demand with `#filename` reference

## Security Guidelines
- NEVER use the `rm` command as it can damage the environment
- If file deletion is necessary, ask the user to do it manually
- Use safe file operations through provided tools (Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
